# Independent-engine workflow

> Historical independent-lab documentation; new Rust work is paused, not complete.
> Current PC continuation: [direction](pc-direction-2026-11-09.md) and the separate
> [GPL architecture](https://github.com/YYoudi/god-hand-pc/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md).

Current priority (2026-11-05): the independent engine is paused, not achieved.
Evaluate the separate faithful PC-port/remaster route under
[port-evaluation-workflow.md](port-evaluation-workflow.md). The original engine
contracts below remain preserved; do not import third-party game/GPL source.

Read clean-room.md, architecture.md and progress-tracking.md.
On resume reconcile the goal, Git state, dashboard data and the ignored
docs/local/progress-checkpoint.md; update that checkpoint at useful boundaries. Historical ghidra_analyze_retail.sh and
prompts 01–05 concern local research; their translations must not enter the engine.
Keep public resources in English and conversations with the owner in French.

The executable first-milestone plan is [G1 initialization](initialization-plan.md).
Record evidence-driven adjustments in [the decision log](initialization-decisions.md).
Keep [reference profiles](reference-profiles.json) separate throughout observations.

## Specify, then implement

Pick a task in docs/dashboard/data.json. Write its contract in specs/ with provenance
and acceptance criteria. Do not transmit game code to the implementer.

```sh
cargo test --workspace --locked
cargo check -p godhand-lab --features viewer --locked
cargo run -p godhand-lab -- --iso "/path/to/God Hand (USA).iso"
cargo run -p godhand-lab -- --iso "/path/to/God Hand (USA).iso" --inspect-textures
cargo run -p godhand-lab -- --iso "/path/to/God Hand (USA).iso" --inspect-rooms
cargo run -p godhand-lab -- --iso "/path/to/God Hand (USA).iso" --room "st1/r100.dat"
cargo run -p godhand-lab -- --iso "/path/to/God Hand (USA).iso" --inspect-meshes "st1/r100.dat"
cargo run -p godhand-lab --features viewer -- --iso "/path/to/God Hand (USA).iso" --mesh "st1/r100.dat" --collection 23 --node 0 --smoke-seconds 60
cargo run -p godhand-lab --features viewer -- --iso "/path/to/God Hand (USA).iso" --texture "etc/subscr/face_hm00.tm2" --smoke-seconds 30
cargo run -p godhand-lab --features viewer -- --iso "/path/to/God Hand (USA).iso" --sandbox
```

Tests are synthetic only. Startup reads the ISO without modifying it, recognizes
the USA serial and does not execute the ELF. The sandbox uses original primitives only.
The separate texture view loads only a bounded supported TIM2 from the user's ISO.
Read the [data map](game-structure-2026-11-03.md) for measured progress and limits.

On this machine, use cargo +stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu with MinGW on PATH.
The historical MSVC path is absent. Local toolchains.lock.json pins research backends;
the independent engine uses Cargo.lock.

## Update the journal

Edit tasks and criteria in docs/dashboard/data.json. Record actual changes, checks
and limitations.

```sh
python scripts/dashboard.py
python scripts/dashboard.py --check
```

After a visual change, capture the displayed journal and record date, provenance
and caption. For visual features also prepare reviewed original Reference / Bevy
pairs with hashes and alignment under progress-tracking.md; do not invent a pair
when reference evidence is missing. Unselected gameplay images remain local. Historical French journal captures can
remain as explicitly labeled archives; new captures use the English page.
Keep static images, third-party results and independent-engine gameplay distinct.

## Publish

Explicitly stage public source, then run:

```sh
python scripts/check_public_tree.py
git diff --cached --stat
git push origin main
```

Free GitHub Pages publishes main:/docs with .nojekyll. No Sites service, paid domain
or custom deployment workflow is used. Checks run on standard public Ubuntu runners
without caches or artifact uploads. Verify CI and the published URL after pushing.

Discs, extractions, tools, Ghidra projects, translated output and gameplay captures
stay local, except selected original rendered comparison pairs registered under
progress-tracking.md. Before prototype/diff work, read unpublished docs/prototype-tcrf-notes.md.

## Placement experiments

Read specs/scr-placement-v1.md before applying transforms. Use dev.ps1
LayoutInspect / Layout, with explicit -RotationOrder when testing multiaxis
hypotheses, -ExcludeCollections for a logged manual resource subset and
-CapturePng for a new renderer-owned PNG. Captures require at least a 10-second
smoke; the snapshot is requested halfway through. Check the actual pixels and
capture result, not only process exit. PPM reference captures publish unchanged
with labeled lossless PNG previews and raw-download links under the protocol.

For a fixed inspection pose use Layout with -CameraEye, -CameraTarget,
-CameraFov and -ViewSize; see specs/inspection-camera-v1.md. Save exact arguments
in the private receipt and describe manual fitting publicly. Do not turn one
landmark match into a recovered-camera or whole-scene fidelity claim.

Source-color investigation: read specs/static-colors-v1.md. Use Layout
-StaticColors only as an explicit experiment and hold the previous camera fixed.
Default/off output, RGB component conformance and full game fidelity are separate
checks. Never publish texture inspection extracts or raw draw/state traces.


For observation-derived static views, read observed-projection-2026-11-04.md.
Layout accepts -CameraAspect and -BackfaceCulling explicitly; neither changes the
default. Distinguish common geometry holdout residuals from image fidelity.
Check also runs `cargo test -p godhand-lab --features viewer --locked` for synthetic
projection/resize/material-key tests without opening a disc or GPU. These tests
are also enabled on the standard free public runner; no new cache/artifact service.
