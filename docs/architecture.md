# ADR 001 — Rust + Bevy independent engine

> Historical independent-lab documentation; new Rust work is paused, not complete.
> Current PC continuation: [direction](pc-direction-2026-11-09.md) and the separate
> [GPL architecture](https://github.com/YYoudi/god-hand-pc/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md).

Current priority (2026-11-05): the independent engine is paused, not achieved.
Evaluate the separate faithful PC-port/remaster route under
[port-evaluation-workflow.md](port-evaluation-workflow.md). The original engine
contracts below remain preserved; do not import third-party game/GPL source.

Date: 2026-11-03. Status: adopted at the user's request.

## Decision

Use Rust for the original engine and Bevy 0.20.1 for ECS, rendering and input.
The engine does not load or execute the MIPS program or link its translation.
Game data will be read from the user's own ISO.

PS2Recomp and ps2-native-recomp remain local research references, not public-engine
dependencies. Their God Hand compatibility is not progress in our independent engine.

| Layer | Responsibility | Foundation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| godhand-disc | Read-only ISO 9660/FST/AFS access, bounds checks | Namespace, ordinal binding and bounded payload windows |
| Formats | Payload decoding, geometry, textures, skeletons, audio | Indexed TIM2/TIM3 with separate raw/presentation-alpha APIs, TM3 banks, DAT/SCP, SCR metadata and static MDB subset with raw optional source colors; animated formats and runtime semantics pending |
| godhand-engine | Original GPU-free testable simulation | Generic X/Z movement, explicit GPU-free placement experiments (runtime semantics unverified), a byte-input blend model and a GPU-free alpha-stage write-permission model (consumed by the opt-in offscreen GPU adapter, not the production retail viewer) |
| Bevy application | Window, rendering, camera, input | ISO texture/static-mesh inspection, diagnostic resource layouts, own-framebuffer PNG capture, opt-in source-color modulation, explicit projection-aspect/culling inspection and original sandbox; native Vulkan visual smokes verified; shared ordered alpha/blend GPU component with explicit per-axis addressing and exact constant-channel preservation, synthetic offscreen conformance and a separate explicit all-resource uniform-state control; per-draw runtime mapping pending |
| Game | Scenes and observable behavior | Not implemented |

The 60 Hz step and sandbox speed are provisional engineering choices, not measurements
of the game. Y is height. Sample input intent per rendered frame and consume it on
the fixed step. Future input edges must be buffered.

## Work required

Formats and scripts, scenes, rendering, animation, collisions, combat, AI, progression,
audio, saves and full-level validation. Bevy does not supply God Hand's logic.
No completion date or gameplay coverage is promised.

## Alternatives

PS2Recomp (GPL-3.0): translation and game-specific handlers; experimental runtime.
ps2-native-recomp (MIT): practical recompilation route, locally tested through the
first fight. PCSX2: behavioral reference, not the Bevy engine.

native-backend-outputs.md for evidence, outputs and boundaries.
